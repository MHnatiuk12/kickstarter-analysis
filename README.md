### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise plan her kickstart campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Based on the launch dates of kickstarters for theaters, we can see that most failed during the month of May, so this would probably be the least successful month to launch a campaign. June and October had the highest successful launches, so these would be good months to consider launching a campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The percentage of kickstarters that were successful is significantly higher than those that failed, so we can confidently say that launching a campaign despite the goal has a probability of being successful. However, this graph also shows us that the higher the amount the less likely a campaign was to fail. Alternatively, the higher the campaign, the more likely it was successful.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There are a lot of factors to take into account. Narrowing the scope will narrow our data, so it's good to take a look at the overall as well as the specifics that are directly correlated to the exact campaign looking to be launched.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
May is not a good month to launch a campaign. The best month to launch a campaign is probably June or October based on the chart.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The higher the goal, the more successful campaigns seemed to be.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The limitations are seeing the individual pledge details.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could take a look at a wider scope, including other countries, or narrowing down based on Louise's goals to see how other campaigns both outside and within her subcategory were successful in comparison.
